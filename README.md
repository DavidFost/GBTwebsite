CONCEPT

I am working on the home page, so I need you to help out on the other links/pages. We are using https://www.afcchicago.org as a design template. The color scheme
is burgundy, blue, gray, black, and white. Any images you need will be in the repo. Let me know if you need specific content. For the content like descriptions,
history of the church, about church, or anything specific like that just put a placeholder. Bro. Ricks will take care of that. 

IMPLEMENTATION (in theory, im still a rookie)

So, we want to build mobile first, its easier that way. That means that we will develop for smaller screen sizes first. In order to do that, I am using media
breakpoints (dont ask about the legality of this). In all the css files, you will find a media breakpoint at 769px (pixels). Meaning, everything outside of that 
breakpoint will apply to screens with less than 769px. So, we're styling for the smaller devices first, then make adjustments to the larger screens (inside
the breakpoint). Some html elements or styles will not need to be shown based on whether its mobile or not, and you can make them disappear with 
"display: none;" in the css file. 


Additionally, we're using css in order to style the pages. JS is completely fine, but I am less knowledgeable
about it. 

If you need to create another page/stylesheet just copy the template html/css file in the repo and build from there. Make sure to link the html to the 
stylesheet you created as well. 

I found that chatGPT and youtube were the quickest learning tools for the basics of html/css. Beyond that, I found myself visiting this site alot as well
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding. You will probably have the most trouble with css as html is pretty straight-forward.
